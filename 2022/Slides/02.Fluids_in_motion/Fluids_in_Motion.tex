\textbf{Blood flow}. In humans, blood flows from the heart into the aorta, from which it passes into the major arteries. These branch into the small arteries (arterioles),
 which in turn branch into myriads of tiny capillaries. The blood returns to the heart via the veins. The radius of the aorta is about $1.2 cm$, and the blood passing through it has 
a speed of about $40 cm/s$. A typical capillary has a radius of about $4 \times 10^{-4} cm$, and blood flows through it at a speed of about $5 \times 10^ {-4} m/s$.

pressure acting on the surface of the liquid in the bowl. Thus atmospheric pressure

In tubes having very small diameters, liquids are observed to rise or fall relative
to the level of the surrounding liquid. This phenomenon is called capillarity

Whether a liquid wets a solid surface is determined by the relative strength of the
cohesive forces between the molecules of the liquid compared to the adhesive forces
between the molecules of the liquid and those of the container. Cohesion refers to the
force between molecules of the same type, whereas adhesion refers to the force between
molecules of different types.

We can distinguish two main types of fluid flow:
\vspace{3mm}

\begin{itemize}
\item Laminar Flow: Smooth flow $\rightarrow$ the neighbouring layers of the fluid slide by each other smoothly
\pause
\item Turbulent Flow: Above a certain speed, the flow is characterized by erratic, small, whirlpool-like circles called eddy currents or
eddies

In streamline flow, each particle of the fluid follows
a smooth path, called a streamline, and these paths do not cross one another.
\vspace{3mm}

In a turbulent Flow, eddies absorb a great deal of energy, and although a certain
amount of internal friction called viscosity is present even during streamline flow,
it is much greater when the flow is turbulent.

The mass flow rate  passing $A_{x2}$ is


\begin{equation*}
\rho  (v_x+\frac{\partial v_x}{\partial x} dx)dydz

\pause
The difference between the mass flow rate entering through $A_{X2}$ and $A_{X1}$ is,

\begin{equation*}
\rho \frac{\partial v_x}{\partial x} dydzdx

\begin{equation*}
\rho \frac{\partial v_y}{\partial y} dydzdx
\end{equation*}

\begin{equation*}
\rho \frac{\partial v_z}{\partial z} dydzdx
\end{equation*}


Then, the difference between the total flow entering and exiting the volume is

\begin{equation*}
\rho( \frac{\partial v_x}{\partial x}+ \frac{\partial v_y}{\partial y}+ \frac{\partial v_z}{\partial z} )dydzdx
\end{equation*}

 \begin{equation*}
\rho( \frac{\partial v_x}{\partial x}+ \frac{\partial v_y}{\partial y}+ \frac{\partial v_z}{\partial z} )dydzdx=0
\end{equation*}

Then,

 \begin{equation*}
( \frac{\partial v_x}{\partial x}+ \frac{\partial v_y}{\partial y}+ \frac{\partial v_z}{\partial z} )=0

To obtain the acceleration we must calculate,
\vspace{3mm}

\begin{equation*}
\frac{\Delta \vec{v}}{\Delta t}
\end{equation*}


for an actual displacement of an element of fluid. That is,


\begin{equation*}
\frac{\Delta \vec{v}}{\Delta t}=v_x \frac{\partial \vec{v}}{\partial x}+v_y \frac{\partial \vec{v}}{\partial y}+v_z \frac{\partial \vec{v}}{\partial z}+\frac{\partial \vec{v}}{\partial t}

Using the nabla,


\begin{equation*}
\vec{a}=(\vec{v}\cdot \nabla)\vec{v}+\frac{\partial \vec{v}}{\partial t}

Then, the second Newton's Law takes the form,

 \begin{equation*}
(\vec{v}\cdot \nabla)\vec{v}+\frac{\partial \vec{v}}{\partial t}=-\frac{\nabla P}{\rho}- \nabla \phi 
\end{equation*}
\pause
This equation can be expressed as,

 \begin{equation*}
\Omega\times\vec{v}+\frac{1}{2}\nabla v^2+\frac{\partial \vec{v}}{\partial t}=-\frac{\nabla P}{\rho}- \nabla \phi 
\end{equation*}

\pause
where,


 \begin{equation*}
\Omega=\nabla\times\vec{v}
