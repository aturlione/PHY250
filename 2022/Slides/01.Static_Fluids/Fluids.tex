The simplest device to measure the pressure  is the open-tube Manometer,  the Pressure is related to the difference $ \Delta h$ between the two levels of the  liquid.

P=P_0+\rho g \Delta h

Instead of calculating the product $\rho g \Delta h$, sometimes only the change in height $\Delta h$ is specified. In fact, pressures are sometimes specified as so many “millimetres
of mercury” (mm-Hg) or “mm of water” (mm-H20).

A barometer is a glass tube completely filled with mercury and then inverted into a bowl of mercury. If the tube is long enough, the level of the mercury will drop, leaving a
vacuum at the top of the tube.

then show that the vector sum of these forces is the buoyant

Then, the most general expression for hydrostatic equilibrium is,

If the density is constant, the equation has a solution,
