\section*{Prerequisites }
 PHY200: Motion dynamics and MAT200 Calculus and Analytical Geometry II.\\
\\
It will be assumed that the student has knowledge in Kinematics, Newtonian Dynamics, work and the law of conservation of 
energy.	
It will also be assumed that the student has some basic knowledge in calculus of derivatives, 
basic trigonometrical curves and operations, common geometrical relations, integral calculus and power series. 
The students should revisit the above topics before entering in deeper physics.

% Second Section %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\section*{Description}

This  course provides a fundamental understanding of 
clasical mechanics, fluid dynamics, oscillations, waves and optics. 
Attention will be paid to numerical applications that are relevant to simulations.  


%\begin{itemize}
%\item Course notes available on Moodle. Books. Tech. Bla bla bla ...
%\end{itemize}

% Third Section %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\section*{Course Objectives and Learning Outcomes }
Upon a successfully completion of this course the students will gain a fundamental understanding of :

\begin{enumerate}
\item  Main characteristic of fluids which will allow them to solve buoyancy problems and describe laminar flow with and without viscosity.
\item  The causes of the oscillations and its mathematical description. The students will be able to find the frequency of simple and physical pendula 
as well as of an oscillating elastic body.
\item  Creation and propagation of mechanical waves and its description through the wave equation.
\item  Interferences between traveling waves. 
\item  The phenomena of standing waves and resonance. The students will learn to find the nodes and the harmonic frequencies of resonance. 
\item The sound and the common effects of its propagation, Doppler effect, beats, etc.
\item  Ray model of light, the foundations of ray tracers and the dual nature of the light.
\item Thermodynamics, the first and second laws, definition of entropy and the microscopic interpretation
\end{enumerate}

% Fourth Section %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\section*{Textbooks}

\begin{itemize}
\item University Physics, 9th Edition, by  Zears $\&$ Zemansky
ISBN: 0 – 201 – 57157 – 9 
\item 
Physics for Scientists and Engineers, Prentice Hall 4th Edition, by Giancoli 
		Chapters:  13-16, 32-34, 17-20  
		ISBN: 0 – 13 – 149508 – 9 

\end{itemize}




\section*{Relation with other subjects}

PHY250 closes PHY300. 
% Fifth Section %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\section*{Grading Policy}

The breakdown of the weighting of the Total Score will be as follows:

\begin{enumerate}
\item  	Homework (30 $\%$)
\item   Mid term (30$\%$)
\item 	Final project (40$\%$)

\end{enumerate}

The minimum grade to pass the subject is 60 \% 



\section*{Homework}

\begin{itemize}
	\item Problem sets are due approximately every two weeks. 
	\item  Work summited late is worth a maximum of 20 \% total credit.
	\item Homework must be summited in Moodle.
  \end{itemize}
  

  \section*{Midterm}


	The midterm is a closed-book exam and consists of solving a set of exercises that cover the theory taught during the first six weeks of class.


  
  \section*{Course Final Project}
  
  The course final project will utilize numerical methods to approximate a physical
  system and resolve the motion and interaction of the objects in the simulation.
  The project is intended as an opportunity to put into practice and further
  develop the techniques learned in the course. 
  


\section*{Relevance/Statement}

It is important to keep up with the material, to study regularly at home (at least 2 hours for every hour in class) and to do as many problems as you can 
(don’t limit yourself to the assigned or recommended problems, or merely the problems that are due).  

	You are welcome to work with other students, so long as the aim is furthering your understanding of the concepts and problem solving techniques. I am 
	happy to help work through problems, either in office hours or in class. Just remember, doing a problem yourself is very different from watching another 
	person do so. If you work together on problem sets, be sure to provide your own solution to every problem proving that you understand your writing. 
	In addition, some exam questions may be a resemblance to homework questions, so you’re encouraged to fully understand what you turn in. 
	Again, reading the relevant book sections before the material is taught is highly recommended.

\section*{Academic Integrity Policy}

Academic dishonesty in any form will not be tolerated in this course. Cheating, copying from any sources (including current or past students work, online sources 
or books), plagiarizing, or any other form of academic dishonesty (including doing someone else’s individual assignments) will result in, at the extreme minimum,
 a zero on the assignment in question, and could result in a failing grade in the course or even expulsion from DigiPen. Assisting others in cheating is prohibited 
 and will be equally punished.

\section*{Disability Support Services}

If students have disabilities and will need formal accommodations in order to fully participate or effectively demonstrate learning in this class, they should 
contact the Administration Office at 946365163. The Administration Office welcomes the opportunity to meet with students to discuss how the accommodations will
 be implemented. Also, if you may need assistance in the event of an evacuation, please let the instructor know.

%\subsection*{Grading Policy}
%The typical NC State grading scale will be used. I reserve the right to curve the scale dependent on overall class scores at the end of the semester. Any curve will only ever make it easier to obtain a certain letter grade. The grade will count the assessments using the following proportions:
%\begin{itemize}
%	\item \underline{\textbf{30\%}} of your grade will be determined by 2 in class midterm exams (15\% each).
%	\item \underline{\textbf{5\%}} of your grade will be determined by ...
%	\item \underline{\textbf{5\%}} ...
