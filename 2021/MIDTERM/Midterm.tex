% Water and then oil (which donâ€™t mix) are poured into a U-shaped tube, open at both
% ends. They come to equilibrium as shown in the figure. What is the density of the oil?

A swimming pool is $5.0~m$ long, $4.0~m$ wide, and
$3.0~m$ deep. Compute the force exerted by the water against (a) the
bottom and (b) either end. (Hint: Calculate the force on a thin, horizontal
strip at a depth $h$, and integrate this over the end of the
pool.) Do not include the force due to air pressure. Density of water: $10^3~kg/m^3$

\section*{Exercise \theexample (25 p)}

Take into account the speed of the top surface of the tank (Fig. \ref{image1}) and show that the speed of
fluid leaving the opening at the bottom is:

\begin{equation*}
  v_1=\sqrt{\frac{2gh}{(1-A^2_1/A^2_2)}}
\end{equation*}
where $h = y_2-y_1$, and $A_1$ and $A_2$ are the areas of the opening and of the top surface,
respectively. Find the distance $d$ at which the fluid reaches the floor.

\section*{Exercise \theexample (25 p)}

A student wants to use a meter stick as a pendulum.
She plans to drill a small hole through the meter stick
and suspend it from a smooth pin
attached to the wall (Fig. \ref{image3} ).
Where in the meter stick should
she drill the hole to obtain the
shortest possible period? How
short an oscillation period can she 
obtain with a meter stick in this
way? 
\vspace{2mm}

Inertia momentum of the stick respect to the center of mass: $\frac{1}{12}ML^2$

% Three pieces of string, each of length $L$, are joined
% together end to end, to make a combined string of length $3L$. The
% first piece of string has mass per unit length $\mu_1$, the second piece
% has mass per unit length $\mu_2=4\mu_1$ and the third piece has mass
% per unit length $\mu_3=\mu_1/4$ (a) If the combined string is under tension
% $F$, how much time does it take a transverse wave to travel the
% entire length $3L$? Give your answer in terms of $L$, $F$, and $\mu_1$
% (b) Does your answer to part (a) depend on the order in which the
% three pieces are joined together? Explain.

A $65-cm$ guitar string is fixed at both ends. In the
frequency range between $1.0$ and $2.0 kHz$, the string is found
to resonate only at frequencies $1.2,1.5$, and $1.8 kHz$. What is
the speed of traveling waves on this string?

The velocity of waves on a string is $96 m/s$. If the
frequency of standing waves is $445 Hz$, how far apart are the
two adjacent nodes?
