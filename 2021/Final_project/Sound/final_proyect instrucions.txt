Final Asigment:







exercise 2: Waves


digitalization of sounds

Violin.

Find the expresion for the armonics in a violin cord.

play the Violin Audio, record the sound with wavesurfer, extract 
the information for the nodes from the espectrum graph.

using octave:

graph the signal (relative amplitudes)
generate a sound

compare both sounds,

where arise the main differences?
how could you improve the quality of the digitalization?


Clarinet

Find the expression for the armonics in a clarinete

play the Violin Audio, record the sound with wavesurfer, extract 
the information for the nodes from the espectrum graph.

using octave:

graph the signal 
generate a sound


compare with the violin sound, what dirrefencies could you observe?

which sound is more simmilar to the original? 
whi do you think, the sound of (violin/clarinet) is more difficult to digitalize?




E1:

Solve a colistion between a particle and a sphere.

Find the expresion for J and the final state of the system.

plot the position of the twobodies for fifferent times in octave
